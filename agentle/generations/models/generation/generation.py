"""
Core Generation model for AI responses in the Agentle framework.

This module defines the Generation class, which serves as the core container for
AI-generated content in the Agentle framework. It encapsulates all aspects of a
model's response, including the generated content itself, metadata, usage statistics,
and structured data parsing.

The Generation model is designed to be provider-independent, allowing applications
to work with different AI providers through a unified interface. It supports
multiple response choices, structured data parsing via generic typing, and
provides convenient accessors for common operations.

The model includes extensive clone functionality to support transformation and
manipulation of generation objects while maintaining immutability.
